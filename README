The PHP-based Web application is a preview of two geolocation methods
used in Android phone application flynor-android (select-airport.php)
and another HTML5-based method (locate-airport.php).

The geopositions of the 47 Norwegian airports operated by Avinor were
found based on the postal numbers for the airports provided by Avinor
and the NRK/yr.no project Norske postnummer.  In FlyNOR 1.4.3 was the
geoposition of the Android phone device automatically found using the
network data (ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) and then the closest airport is
found by computing the shortest Manhattan distance between the gpspos
of the device and the geopositions of the airports.

1st geolocation implementation was written by Ole Aamot, August 2009.
2nd geolocation implementation was written by Ole Aamot, August 2011.

The Avinor PHP API Library was initially written by Flamur Mavraj and
forked by Ole Aamot from version 1.1 for better language support, GPS
geolocations, more air shuttle logos and for booking link for flights
operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle (DY).
